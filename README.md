# E-commerce Back End

## Description
This app configures an Express.js API with Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This app can be used by internet retail companies to set up an e-commerce database using the latest technologies.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The user will save a dotenv file to store their sensitive environmental variables and data.
Use MySQL commands to create the database. 
Run the npm start script to start the server.

Use the API routes to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to the database.

The video demo includes sample data to seed the database, and tests the API routes using Insomnia:
